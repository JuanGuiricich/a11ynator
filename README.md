This is a work in progress for a gem Idea I had.

The purpose is to identify those img tags with no alt text to correct them easily.

This will help users not only to align to accessibility rules but also to position better in SEO.

And if you are better in SEO, Google will like you more, and hey, maybe you'll sell a little bit more!
